              Why we give with structure
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Regular, structured giving is a habit, not a finish line. Spiritual traditions across Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Judaism, and others have long recommended setting aside roughly ten percent of income to care for community. We follow that wisdom, pair it with data, and commit to realistic percentages we can maintain year after year.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
              <p class="emphasis">
                Start early, stay consistent, compare notes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We began structured giving right out of college. Setting a fixed portion of every paycheck--even when they were small--made support for others a default decision. We also talk about giving with friends and colleagues, not to compare totals, but to swap ideas on high-impact causes and keep each other accountable.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Philanthropy observers often note that Silicon Valley households donate a smaller share of income than national averages. New wealth can arrive before a giving habit forms. We want to normalize talking about philanthropic strategy in tech circles, encourage first-jobs donors to start small, and show how an intentional plan keeps impact from becoming another "someday" project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our north star is simple: thoughtful giving should feel approachable. The goal of this site is to share what works for us--clear priorities, transparent partners, and honest reflections--so you can adapt it for your own values.

              Investing in education with JAAGO Foundation

            <p>
              We funded the land purchase for two JAAGO Foundation school sites in Bangladesh: Teknaf in Cox's Bazar District and a new campus in Dhaka. Together they will serve more than 1,500 children each year with evidence-based, locally led instruction that keeps students on a path to secondary education and stable employment.

                        I helped start this hackerspace in South Bay in 2010; it was the birthplace of Pinterest, Matterport, Webflow, Pebble Watch, and more. It is a superb place for people to transition their careers to tech and to level up and helps teach thousands of people a month about technology and community.

                  Transparency keeps us accountable and, we hope, encourages others to map out their own giving strategies. This isn't victory laps--it's an invitation to a conversation about what's working and what still needs support.

                  Pick a percentage that feels meaningful but sustainable--maybe 3% while you pay off loans, or 10% if you're ready to tithe. Automate it, review annually, and increase as your capacity grows.

                  Absolutely. Regular contributions--no matter the size--let nonprofits plan. Even $25 a month through a DAF or direct recurring gift adds up quickly and keeps you engaged with the impact you care about.

              We love hearing how others structure their giving plans, which organizations inspire them, and what questions they're wrestling with.

              We'll add a dedicated email address soon. In the meantime, feel free to reach out through the channels you already have for David or Rebecca, or flag us on social when you publish your own giving roadmap.

              If you build a page like this, let us know--we'd be thrilled to share it.
